# Traffic Volume Prediction using LSTM Neural Network

## Overview

Traffic congestion is a growing issue in urban areas worldwide, affecting commuter experiences and infrastructure planning. This project aims to predict traffic volume on specific road segments using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, a model well-suited for time series forecasting due to its ability to learn temporal dependencies.

By leveraging historical traffic data, the model will help anticipate high traffic volumes, enabling better traffic management, optimized traffic signals, and improved road maintenance planning.

## Objectives

- Predict future traffic volume on road segments based on historical data.
- Utilize an LSTM neural network for time series forecasting.
- Enable traffic management systems to plan effectively, reduce congestion, and improve commuter travel time.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project comes from traffic monitoring systems and includes features such as:

- **Date**: The specific date of the traffic data entry.
- **Time**: The time of day when traffic volume was recorded.
- **Traffic Volume**: The number of vehicles passing through a road segment in a given period.

## Model and Approach

- **LSTM Neural Network**: The LSTM model is chosen due to its ability to handle long-term dependencies in time series data.
- **Time Series Forecasting**: The project focuses on forecasting traffic volumes using historical data with features like date and time.
